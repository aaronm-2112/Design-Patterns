// Purpose: Provides the interface for a observer working with a Subject that utilizes the push approach to the observer pattern. 
// Note:    A con of this approach is whenever the subject changes data, every observer has to change as well. 
//          Additionally, unless optional parameters are used, an observer is forced to accommodate for parameters it will never use.
